<hr/>

System Design is an essential skill for every software engineer. The magnitude of involvement will differ from person to person based on their experience and seniority. It is also critically important in the interview evaluation process. It shows how well you understand software system and computer science applied to real-life problems.

While abundant resource about how to be an expert on system design, it still remains as a difficult skill for engineers to obtain. Usually, people are biased by years of experience when judging your system design capability. More extremely, some people might not believe you are able to design a complicated system without years of experience above a threshold. 

It’s indeed intricate but not without possibility for us to excel it even with few practical experience. We usually see in many well-design systems, there are “trade-offs” all over the place. Trade-off is when you trade A with B
